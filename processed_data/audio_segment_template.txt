This is a template for processed audio segments. Each segment will be a clean, standardized WAV file, ready for ASR transcription. The actual files will be located in the `processed_data/processed_audio/` directory.

Example naming convention:
`original_audio_file_name_segment_X.wav`

Associated metadata (stored in `processed_data_metadata.json`) will include:
- `path`: Path to the WAV file
- `original_path`: Path to the original raw audio/video file
- `segment_index`: Index of the segment within the original file
- `data_type`: "audio_segment" or "audio_segment_from_video"
- `timestamp`: Processing timestamp
