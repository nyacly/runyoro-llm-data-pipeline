# Runyoro/Rutooro LLM Data Processing Pipeline

This repository contains the implementation of a data processing pipeline for the Runyoro/Rutooro LLM project. The pipeline is designed to ingest and preprocess various data sources, including PDFs, images, websites, audio files, and video files, to prepare them for training a Large Language Model (LLM) in Runyoro/Rutooro.

## Project Structure

- `raw_data/`: Directory for raw, unprocessed data.
- `processed_data/`: Directory for processed and cleaned data, ready for LLM training.
- `scripts/`: Contains Python scripts for different stages of the pipeline.
- `docs/`: Documentation related to the pipeline.

## Getting Started

Further instructions on setting up and running the pipeline will be provided here.
